# Credit_Card_Financial Dashboard ( Using POWER BI)
## Project Objective
To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively. Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard using SQL data to monitor credit card performance. Used DAX to calculate KPIs like revenue, transactions, and customer trends. Visualized insights on card types, regions, and demographics to support real-time, data-driven decision-making.

## Questions (KPI)
1.What is the total revenue generated this week, and how does it compare to the previous week?  

2.Which credit card category (Blue, Silver, Gold, Platinum) contributes the most to overall revenue?

3.What is the current activation rate of issued credit cards?

4.What is the delinquency rate among active customers?

5.Which states or regions contribute the highest percentage of revenue?

6.How does customer gender distribution impact revenue generation?

7.What are the weekly trends in transaction count and transaction amount?

8.How does revenue vary across different customer income and age groups?

9.Which job categories or education levels are associated with higher transaction volumes or revenue?

10.What is the average revenue per customer, and how is it trending over time?

## Process
- Imported and structured raw data from CSV files into a relational SQL database, ensuring data integrity and normalization.
- Executed complex SQL queries to extract, filter, and aggregate transactional and customer data for analysis.
- Developed DAX measures and calculated columns in Power BI to derive KPIs such as revenue growth, customer segmentation, and   transaction trends.
- Designed a visually compelling and user-friendly dashboard to present real-time insights across key performance areas.
- Validated results and shared interactive reports with stakeholders to support informed financial and strategic decisions.

## Project Insights

- Achieved a 28.8% week-over-week increase in total revenue by tracking and analyzing key performance indicators.
- Identified that Blue and Silver credit cards contribute to over 93% of total transactions.
- Revealed that Texas, New York, and California account for 68% of overall revenue, highlighting regional performance.
- Discovered that male customers generated higher revenue (₹31M) compared to female customers (₹26M).
- Measured an overall activation rate of 57.5% and a delinquency rate of 6.06%, enabling risk assessment.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates the power of integrating SQL-based data processing with Power BI’s advanced visualization capabilities to drive meaningful business insights. By leveraging DAX for dynamic calculations and designing intuitive dashboards, the analysis uncovered critical trends in customer behavior, regional performance, and card-category contributions. The comprehensive insights not only enhanced operational transparency but also empowered stakeholders with data-driven strategies for revenue growth, customer engagement, and risk mitigation. This end-to-end solution exemplifies how thoughtful analytics can transform raw financial data into actionable intelligence.
